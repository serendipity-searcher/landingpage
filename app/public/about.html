            SEARCHER is an interactive prototype that explores digital
            collections as forms of participatory curation. The project designs
            ways to foster new readings of the collection through interpretation
            and engagement. To facilitate this, we bring together layers of
            (machine-learning) techniques to analyze interconnections within
            collection holdings. Given that the museum's frontend grants access
            to only a fraction of its holdings through fixed displays and
            long-serving narratives, the project argues for more open
            circulation of search, stories, and sharing within museums.

            Inspired by the image atlases of Aby Warburg (1866–1929) – which
            mapped visual themes across time through 'alliances of attraction'–
            SEARCHER reimagines the visual map as a curatorial 'thinking space',
            where searching and finding become spatial and social acts. The aim
            is to challenge the notion that collection search has defined
            boundaries and instead to embrace serendipity — finding something
            you were not initially searching for. This concept is integral to
            the installation's performative function, where your chosen set of
            objects, written queries, or contextualization of your findings
            opens new avenues for inquiry. Consequently, the installation builds
            off of your search, uncovering hidden relationships that emerge and
            evolve over time.

            The project was initiated by Searcher Studio, a collective of art,
            design, and data experts whose work explore creative ways for people
            to engage with digital heritage collections. The team (2023-2024)
            consists of Thomas Hügin, Maja Kolar, Boris Smeenk, Jon Stam and
            Valentin Vogelmann. Realized in partnership with Culture Center
